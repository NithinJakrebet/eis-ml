### **Should You Use a Python Script (`.py`) or a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) for Loading Data?**
Both **Python scripts** and **Jupyter notebooks** have their advantages, and the best choice depends on your workflow needs. Here's how to decide:

---

## **Best Practice: Use a Python Script (`load_data.py`) for Reusability**
âœ… **Recommended when you want to:**
- **Reuse** the data loading function across multiple notebooks and scripts.
- **Avoid redundancy** (e.g., not rewriting data loading in every notebook).
- **Keep the code modular** and maintainable.
- **Automate processes** (e.g., running scripts via `cron`, Docker, or CI/CD).

ðŸ“Œ **Where to put it?**  
Place `load_data.py` inside the `scripts/` directory.

### **How to Use the Script in a Notebook?**
Once you've written `load_data.py`, you can import and use it inside a Jupyter Notebook like this:

```python
from scripts.load_data import load_data

# Load all datasets
data = load_data()

# Access a specific dataset
df_a1 = data["Channel A1.csv"]
print(df_a1.head())
```

## **When to Use a Jupyter Notebook (`load_data.ipynb`)?**
âœ… **Use a Jupyter notebook if you want to:**
- **Explore data interactively** before finalizing the pipeline.
- **Perform data cleaning, transformations, and visualizations** in an iterative way.
- **Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.

ðŸ“Œ **Where to put it?**  
Place it inside the `notebooks/` directory.

## **Best Practice for a Team: Use Both**
1. **Use `load_data.py` in `scripts/`** for structured, reusable data loading.
2. **Use Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/`** for analysis and visualization.
3. **Document the workflow in `README.md` or `data.md`** to guide team members.

ðŸš€ **Final Decision?**  
- **For structured projects â†’ Use `load_data.py` (Python script).**
- **For exploration and EDA â†’ Use `explore_data.ipynb` (Notebook).**
- **For best results â†’ Use both!** ðŸ˜Š
