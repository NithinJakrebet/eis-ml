### **Should You Use a Python Script (`.py`) or a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`) for Loading Data?**
Both **Python scripts** and **Jupyter notebooks** have their advantages, and the best choice depends on your workflow needs. Here's how to decide:

---

## **Best Practice: Use a Python Script (`load_data.py`) for Reusability**
✅ **Recommended when you want to:**
- **Reuse** the data loading function across multiple notebooks and scripts.
- **Avoid redundancy** (e.g., not rewriting data loading in every notebook).
- **Keep the code modular** and maintainable.
- **Automate processes** (e.g., running scripts via `cron`, Docker, or CI/CD).

📌 **Where to put it?**  
Place `load_data.py` inside the `scripts/` directory.

### **How to Use the Script in a Notebook?**
Once you've written `load_data.py`, you can import and use it inside a Jupyter Notebook like this:

```python
from scripts.load_data import load_data

# Load all datasets
data = load_data()

# Access a specific dataset
df_a1 = data["Channel A1.csv"]
print(df_a1.head())
```

---

## **When to Use a Jupyter Notebook (`load_data.ipynb`)?**
✅ **Use a Jupyter notebook if you want to:**
- **Explore data interactively** before finalizing the pipeline.
- **Perform data cleaning, transformations, and visualizations** in an iterative way.
- **Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**.

📌 **Where to put it?**  
Place it inside the `notebooks/` directory.

## **Best Practice for a Team: Use Both**
1. **Use `load_data.py` in `scripts/`** for structured, reusable data loading.
2. **Use Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/`** for analysis and visualization.
3. **Document the workflow in `README.md` or `data.md`** to guide team members.

🚀 **Final Decision?**  
- **For structured projects → Use `load_data.py` (Python script).**
- **For exploration and EDA → Use `explore_data.ipynb` (Notebook).**
- **For best results → Use both!** 😊

Zim(ω1), Zim(ω2), ... Zim(ω60)]T are the real (Zre) and imaginary (Zim) parts of impedance spectra collected at 60 different frequencies (ωn, n = 1, 2, ..., 60))


 State vectors: We frame the problem as a regression task, and train a probabilistic machine learning model to learn the mapping Qn = f(sn, an), with uncertainty estimates, where sn is the battery state at the start of the nth cycle, an is the future action (the nth cycle charge/ discharge protocol), and Qn is the discharge capacity measured at the end of the cycle. The battery state vector sn is formed from the con- catenation of the real (Z re ) and imaginary (Z im ) components of the impedance measured at 57 frequencies, ω1, . . . , ω57, in the range 0.02Hz-20kHz; sn =1⁄2Zreðω1Þ,Zimðω1Þ,:::,Zreðω57Þ,Zimðω57Þ.
